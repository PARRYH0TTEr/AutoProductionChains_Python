#IMPORTANT 1.1 -> Add the sourcecode to Github. Get version control working (but do not remove old code,
#               -> might be worth to compare the two programs that generate the same blueprint to compare performance)



#IMPORTANT 2.1 -> Each provider should have a list of all the structures/processes that it contains
#               -> and then the Build<Dir> should just adjust the tile_position and direction of the objects.
#               -> We do this so that we can pass a specific structure and thereby specific tile_position
#               -> (which translates to an anchor point) for all subsequent structures/children

#TODO1.1 -> FIXME1.1


#TODO1.2 -> At the moment, denoting the rate at which the graph should provide the desired output does nothing.
#        -> Make it (somewhat) dynamic in choosing which it should use, perhaps by looking up the speed of each and selecting
#        -> based on the first substructure that meets the criteria


#TODO1.3 -> Implement a graph class that represents the "m-ary tree" that should be used to represent the graph
#        -> Look into using Graphviz
